**zzuf-maps** is a repository of Minecraft PvP maps created by [@zzufx](https://github.com/zzufx), for use with the [PvP Game Manager](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM) plugin.

# Folders
A description of each folder's contents

### includes
This folder contains custom gamemode files I've made that are required by some of my maps (e.g.: Bridge maps need the [bridge.xml](https://github.com/zzufx/zzuf-maps/blob/master/includes/bridge.xml) include to work). Some gamemodes, like Bed Wars and Ghost Squadron, use include files that were only partially or not made by me, which you can find in [OvercastCommunity/PublicMaps](https://github.com/OvercastCommunity/PublicMaps/tree/main/includes).

These files go into the includes folder defined in PGM's *config.yml*

### maps
This is a collection of maps I've worked on where I had complete or the biggest share of creative input. This folder contains maps for Minecraft versions 1.8 and 1.21, some maps having variants of themselves for both versions.

The following maps can be found in this repo. Maps with variants have the "main" map in **bold**.
